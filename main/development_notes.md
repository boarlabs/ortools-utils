# Sever Kickoff

okay where to start? 
I guess first I could apply/compile the changes on protos
on the client side I created the sample message list.
I did not create an RPC in the protos and did not include the stub, and client codes.
I could also add the standard service codes on the server to receive the request.
Then I guess I could start thinking what to do with the data.
