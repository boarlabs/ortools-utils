okay where to start? 
I guess first I could apply/compile the changes on protos
on the client side I created the sample message list.
I did not create an RPC in the protos and did not include the stub, and client codes.
I could also add the standard service codes on the server to receive the request.
Then I guess I could start thinking what to do with the data.

# Wiki Pages and docs

so the other day I was thinking about having a document like this
in the repo. well it is not certaily the norm.
the professional way is to put it in the code, docstrings, right?
but for someone like me that likes to wramble when working to keep track of my 
disperse thoughts, would that work?
(again I think that failed repo profaneDB can teach me a thing or two in this area.)

Anyways, I guess I couod put this in a docs directory, not important.
but the docs directory is more for code usage and API...
This is more like a blog.
